- if you have a variable at a package level, and it is lowercase then it's scoped to the package. any file in the same package
can access that variable.
if it's uppercase at the package level, then it's exported from the package and is globally visible.
third is block scope. variable declared inside a block remain there and cant be accessed outside of that.
